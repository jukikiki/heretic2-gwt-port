== 17th August 2010==

=== Game Engine ===

The game engine has been tested to not need any updates to loading the maps or the content files from the game.

=== Items ===

the system needs all items building for heretic2 with the files they are to load and the stats they change. how every the quake2 loading engine dose appears to not need changing for this it looks for method for items that are not there but once the rebuild of the method has been done should work fine.
